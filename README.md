# Huffman-Coding
I created Huffman.java and HuffmanDemo.java to use a binary tree and pair object to encode and decode Pokemon.txt. This project was created in my Data Structures and Algorithms class with code provided by my Professor Srinivas Sampalli.

Instructions for interacting with HuffmanDemo.java: 
1. enter "Pokemon.txt" as the file to encode
2. enter "Encoded.txt" as the file to decode
3. enter "Huffman.txt" as the file containing Huffman codes
